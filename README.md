The objective is to give insights of COVID-19. For that, It will be shown how is the number of deaths and vaccinations for each continent and country. This analysis is based on real data about covid 19 from January 2020 to July 2021 using My SQL.

For the project some steps has been followed:

1 - Table creation for deaths and vaccinations.

2 - Loading of datasets using Command Line Client.

3 - Exploratory analysis using aggregations, joins, window fuction, common table expressions (CTE) and views.





Conclusion:

1 - USA, Brazil and India are the top 3 in the number of deaths.

2 - The top three countries with highest percentage of people infected is: Andorra, Seychelles and Montenegro.

3 - In Brazil at the beginning of May/2021, the percentage of the population vaccinated with at least the first dose was 18.50%, and at the end of May/2021 this percentage was 26.11%.
